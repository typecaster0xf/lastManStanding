This is something I started one Friday afternoon when I
was playing a marble game called Last Man Standing.  It
occurred to me that the only reason the game was fun was
due to the limits of human short-term memory, but an
exhaustive recursive depth-first search for the solution
would not suffer such a problem (assuming enough stack
space).

The solution is taking a long time to run, so I may need
to incorporate GPGPU programming.
